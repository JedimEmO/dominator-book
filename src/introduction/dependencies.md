# Dependencies


To build the examples, you will need to have rust with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed.

After following the instructions from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), you can install the target with:

```
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Now install node and npm using nvm, use the latest LTS version.
Instructions on how to do this can be found [in the nvm repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
