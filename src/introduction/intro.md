## Intro

DOMINATOR is a Zero-cost ultra-high-performance declarative DOM library using FRP signals for Rust!

It is based on functional reactive principles, and relies on the [futures_signals](https://crates.io/crates/futures-signals) crate.

This book is accompanied by a few examples, which can be found in the `book/tutorials/` directory.
You can serve a locally hosted version of the examples by running the following:

```shell
cd book/tutorials/<example>
npm install
npm start
```

This should open a browser window, with each example in a separate tab.
If you modify the code, the browser should automatically reload the page and reflect your changes.

The intro chapters will run through a set of examples showing how to use DOMINATOR.
There are references to the tutorial applications, which serve as starting point for your own experimentation!
They will not go into extreme detail of every concept used; this will be covered in later sections of the book.
