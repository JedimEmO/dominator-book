# The Dominator Book

This book aims to serve as a starting point for learning and exploring the [**DOMINATOR**](https://github.com/Pauan/rust-dominator) framework made by [Pauan](https://github.com/Pauan).
It is still work in progress, but should hopefully give at least some value for the very basics.
